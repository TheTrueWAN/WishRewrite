A "wish" is a part of a person; I call it a shard of the soul. It is one's greatest desire, something that one would set one's entire life toward fulfilling. It is distinct from what one loves, for it is built upon it. Those who haven't achieved their wish bear it as a burden, those who can carry it will march on and achieve it, others will collapse under it. Some try to cast it aside, or exchange it, seldom but to much success.
[[Magnifico]]'s magic allows him to cut out this shard of the soul. This changes people, for their need, their drive is lost. Indeed, they can find fulfilment in their actions, just not something that lasts.

The Wishing Star is a kind of mythology. Some fantastical element that the story should really be revolving around. How can I do it?
Brainstorm:
wishing
	connected to wishes
	grants them
	makes them
star
	a ball of gas in the sky
	we look up to it
	we reach for them, only to fall short
	they have existed beyond our time, they have seen the past, our short lives mere blips of theirs;<b> "there is nothing new under the sun (stars)"</b>
	they may be dead and we don't know, for their last light shines long after they die
	their death is violent or quiet.
I suppose that the stars would act as some kind of god-like being. Maybe a pantheon. [[Magnifico]]'s magic has brought their secret to the earth.
Is [[Magnifico]]'s power derived from the stars?

Maybe the wishing stars are deeply connected with [[Magnifico]]'s past kingdom. This would mean that [[Magnifico]] is keenly aware of them.
Maybe he saw that the wish granting of the wishing stars was being abused by the people, and when he wished for the safety of the kingdom, it didn't happen, thus he decided that he would grant wishes in place of the stars that betrayed his old kingdom.
This does have religious ideas behind it, why would a good god let bad things happen and so forth.
My solution is this: "God will always do what is right first, and what is loving second. Indeed bad things will happen, but the machinations of God are far greater than any human can see from the sliver of reality he can perceive from where he stands. Thus it is all for the good, just not in the present."
However, a wishing star isn't God. How are they distinct? Maybe they are loving, but not just, they granted nearly every wish that they were presented with, and this led to the downfall of the kingdom. [[Magnifico]] is stingy with wish granting for this reason.
