The mentor for [[Asha]]. He/She is the one that gave [[Asha]] the spark that drives his life; the theme of the story of the value of hard work. An elder of the community. Spent his/her life striving to achieve the wish: <b>"My legacy to be a masterpiece cherished by generations" </b>. 
(Could the Walt Disney representative be The Artist? In the movie the wish was to "Inspire the next generation." Which sounds both less and more grand at once, but certainly noble.)
His/Her greatest achievement was the masterpiece on display for the whole kingdom to enjoy. Maybe it was a statue, a painting, maybe he designed the palace that the royalty inhabit?
<b>What were his ties to royalty?</b>
	He was [[Magnifico]]'s friend and worked with him to design and build the kingdom of [[Rosas]].
	He had nothing to do with royalty, a simple man who carved his way through the world.
	He should contrast with [[Magnifico]]; the subtheme that "no man is an island" should also be proven with him. That is, he should only have created his masterpiece with the support of the people around him; other people supported him in areas beyond his striving to achieve his wish.
<b>Do people remember who made the masterpiece?</b>
	Maybe the name as a legend, but not the person who bears it. The legend is born nominally of the truth like all stories.


A room of failed attempts
	Used to show [[Asha]] the cost of hard work; the masterpiece. The Artist reveals to him that there were tens if not hundreds of failed attempts before he/she achieved the masterpiece that people know the artist for. To the artist, the masterpiece is not special because of its beauty, but because of the time investment and work that it represented for the artist's life.

Life continues long after one's greatest achievement.
	What did the artist do after completing his/her masterpiece?
	Did he milk his masterpiece for all its worth, continually harkening back to his past days?
	Did he march on, making other works?
	Did he rest, satisfied with his lot?
