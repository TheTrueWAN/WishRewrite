[[Asha]] is inspired by [[The Artist]] at a young age. He sees [[Magnifico]] as a role model and wants to learn magic like him.
At his wishing ceremony when he turns eighteen, he refuses [[Magnifico]] from taking his wish, instead asking that he may grant his own wish. The public find this idea novel, but [[Magnifico]] is excited that someone wants to be taught instead of magically have the knowledge ([[Magnifico]] does see what [[Asha]]'s wish is at this point, and decides that teaching him is appropriate). To that end he gives [[Asha]] the opportunity to be his apprentice, to see if he could become a great wizard like himself.

Alternative:
Have [[The Artist]] only inspire [[Asha]] halfway or so through the story.
This would lead to a character arc: initially disagreeing with [[Magnifico]] over wishes being granted, then learning that people should really be granting their own wishes.

---
[[Asha]] ends up becoming the king's apprentice and proves himself time and again with his resourcefulness and hard work; rare traits among the rest of the kingdom.
He develops a close relationship with the king and queen during his training and learns something of their history and the tragedy of [[The Fallen Kingdom]].
He also notices how people treat him differently now that he is thought to be learning how to grant wishes; this is his first contact with the greed of the people.
Because the queen is barren, they have been looking for an heir to take over the kingdom once they die. As they have come to learn more about [[Asha]] they decide that he may well be the one that they are looking for.
Thus after a year or so of training, [[Magnifico]] decides that it is time to teach [[Asha]] the "the spell that grants a wish". The apprentice will grant his first wish at the next wishing ceremony. To this end [[Magnifico]] shows [[Asha]] at last to the chamber where he keeps all the wishes. [[Asha]] marvels at the wishes; and notices that all the wishes he sees seem good.
Initially, [[Magnifico]] is gentle with him, explaining that "the spell that grants a wish" is fickle, and that he cannot see the full scope of the wishes that he takes, for that lies in the rest of the soul and [[Wishes and Wishing Stars|not the shard he cuts out]]. [[Asha]] says that if he won't grant the wish, he might as well give them back to the people so that they can grant the wishes without magic; if there's trouble then without magic granting the wish, it will be easy to stop. [[Magnifico]] points out that he is releasing people of their burden; without the wish to weigh them down they live happier lives.

Now, in the above rewrite in which [[The Artist]] is needed to inspire [[Asha]] to grant wishes by hand and not magic, [[Asha]] hasn't spoke to [[The Artist]] yet. [[Asha]] up to this point wanted to make people happy by granting wishes. Indeed, he may have some half-formed notion of the joy of hard work (he learned many smaller spells before the spell that grants a wish), but his conviction is incomplete. Maybe he could reflect on his time as an apprentice and all its struggle just before seeing the chamber of wishes. This would instil enough will to make him want to contradict the king and say that people should grant their own wishes, but he hasn't seen the scale to which he is right

[[Magnifico]] snaps a bit. Saying that it is for the good of the people that he holds the wishes, and if his apprentice can't see that after all this time (maybe bringing up the greed of the people that [[Asha]] witnessed during his time as an apprentice; how they treat him better in hopes of getting their wishes granted), then his is no longer [[Magnifico]]'s apprentice. He tells [[Asha]] to leave the castle; there is nothing more between them to be said.

[[Asha]] leaves, dejected that his wish of becoming a wizard has been crushed by the man he looked up to. 
Note some fear that he will want his own wish taken so that he doesn't have to face carrying the burden for the rest of his life.
As much as he wants the support of his parents, he also doesn't want to face them; he takes a longer way home, circling a part of the island he doesn't go to often (but vaguely remembers?) At his point he hears [[The Artist]] at work and speaks with him, leading to the scene in which [[Asha]] sees the "room of failed attempts" and maybe shows [[The Artist]] a few of the things he learned while at the castle. [[The Artist]] praises him, and at this point he realises he was right: it is better that wishes be granted by hand instead of magic. His motive is set for the rest of the story: give people their wishes back so that the joy he shared that night with [[The Artist]] can also be shared with [[Rosas]].

He returns home to his family to share an evening meal with them; although he left the castle a little before midday, he still arrived home as he would a routine day as the king's apprentice; thus his family doesn't know that he has been cast out, only that he is both happy and restless.

Now, as an 18yr old commoner in the kingdom of [[Rosas]], [[Asha]] doesn't know how to govern a kingdom. A decision must be made:
A)
	[[Magnifico]]'s villainy is because he let his ego overtake him due to some force. Thus his crimes are forgivable enough such that after the climax and its buildup in which he eats people's wishes for their power, he is still their ruler, just stripped of his magic. His intentions were solely good after all.
B)
	[[Queen Amaya]] manipulated [[Magnifico]] and was the real villain all along; she is deposed to her husbands dismay and [[Magnifico]] rules over the kingdom again, probably with his magic stripped.
C)
	[[Magnifico]] is betrayed by his loving wife after she realises that he has completely fallen for to evil. To her dismay she has to cast out her husband and rule the kingdom without him, maybe training [[Asha]] to take his place.
D)
	[[Asha]] is actually of the royal family and was brought up thereby. Being royalty all along means that his parents [[Magnifico]] and [[Queen Amaya]] can both be deposed and the kingdom will still stand. It is the simplest conclusion.
