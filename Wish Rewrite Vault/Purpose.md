The purpose of this rewrite is to capture what I think would be an interesting yet underexplored element in that Disney movie Wish's world:
"Our wishes shouldn't be given to us, but instead grasped with our owns two hands."
To that end:
"It is good that we enjoy our hard work and the fruit it bears."
This idea is found in Ecclesiastes.
The subtheme of "no man is an island" also has developed to describe [[Magnifico]]'s fall into villainy, but we'll see if it is a good idea to keep.

What kind of story is this?
I want it to be fun, but to have some terrifying ideas the more you think about it; an entertaining story with some food for thought when you finish it.
Character interactions and dialogue should mostly be fun.
	Maybe have Braverly Second style speech quirks, eg
		A character who "must repeat himself for emphasis"
		A character who takes and invents every opportunity to use the word "deny"
		Another who speaks in French as emphasis and as plot point.
		Another who shouts the last three words of every sentence for emphasis
		Another who talks about everything being "divine".
		Another who talks like a cowboy out of an old Western.
		etc.
	Consider having very unsubtle naming conventions that telegraph some element of the character's personality.
The subject matter is very much that of a Shonen. How can I do better than that though?
